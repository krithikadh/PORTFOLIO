          Hi! I'm a pre-final B.Tech student specializing in Artificial
          Intelligence & Data Science. Apart from being proficient in
          programming languages like Java, C, Python, HMTL, CSS, JavaScript, I'm
          also skilled in using tools like Figma and PowerBI. I hold a special
          interest towards Full Stack Web Development and UI/UX Designing and
          intend to work on projects where technology and creativity comes
          together. Along with excellent communication skills, adaptability and
          ability to multitask, I'm a quick learner open to pursue new things to
